# Hangman-Project
A basic game of hangman written in python with ascii art. The word is randomly selected from a list imported from a module, and the player can guess the word till the man is hanged. The game ends when the man is hanged or the correct letters in the word is guessed.

Modules like hangman_art and hangman_words are created for this game. 
Since this project was originally made on Replit, the packager files are added here.
